## About

These are Postman collections for showcasing Onna.

The environment.json files provided contain a list of variables used by the API collection.

Refer to our [documentation](https://developers.onna.com "Link to Onna developer docs") for usage, and to register a Developer account with us.

## Requirements

- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), which is available for free.


## Installing (Via Github Download)

TODO: Add screens and rewrite below, because we may have more collections in the future!

1) Download `onna-api-example.json` and `environment.json` onto your local machine.
2) Open Postman, click on Import and select the two JSON files.
3) Once imported, a new API collection will be created, along with the environment.
4) Update the environment values.
